          We are so old and wrinkly, we forgot the value of money! We had no
          idea the value of the dollar was so low and that the value of a cup of
          coffee was so high!

          Thanks to Amirs Budget Tracker, we have been able to see where Ol'
          George spends his war bonds and retirement money! Boy, was he upset
          when I, his wife, found out he spends it all down at sally's beauty
          and strip. Over 60 years of marriage, all down the drain! But at least
          we know how to budget better. Thanks Amir!

          I used to spend my days girl-bossing, slaying and overall being a bad-ass. I would work hard and play hard.

          I used to spend my days drifting in and out of consiousness. Only spending my waking hours by playing video games and yelling at my mom for more TotinosÂ© pizza rolls. That was before I discovered the amazing world of cryptocurrency and the blockchain! Now I spend my waking hours watching currencies rise and fall, buying the dip when I can and then watching a scammer dump a coin and steal all my invested money away. But boy, am I bad with my finances sometimes!

          This was well before I found Amir's 'My-Budget'! Now I never fail for crypto pump and dump scams! I mean... I do... But I have a better grasp on my budget now, So I can account for my gains and losses!
